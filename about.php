                    <p><b>Our Vision</b></p>

<p>Tapach Youth Empowerment Organization was established in 2018 by Samuel Korinyang, a member of the County Assembly of West 
    Pokot representing Tapach Ward. </p><p>The organization was born out of a vision to tackle the prevalent issues of youth inexperience
     in productive skills, lack of service duties to the community such us (tree planting, community clean up, public 
     awareness campaigns and clothing drives) and shortage of mentorship programs that address major challenges faced by 
     youths in West Pokot County. Korinyang, witnessing the struggles and untapped potential of the local youth, 
     sought to create a platform that would empower them through access to skill development resources, community 
     service duties and mentorship programs.</p><p>
Since its inception, the organization has steadily grown and has become a beacon of hope for many young people in the region.
 What began as a grassroots initiative with a handful of volunteers has evolved into a well-structured entity supported 
 by a team of professionals, mentors, and trainers dedicated to the organizationâ€™s mission. The organization operates 
 from its head office in Kapenguria town and has extended its reach through various community-based programs and initiatives.</p><p>
The organization's approach is multifaceted, focusing on three main areas: community service duties, skill development,
 and mentorship. By providing skill-building resources, including training workshops, community service duties and educational materials, are made available to help the youth enhance their competencies and empower their growth, skills that offer opportunities in future. Furthermore, the mentorship programs offer guidance and support from experienced professionals, helping the youth navigate their career paths and personal development.
